# This month in mathlib (Aug 2021)

## Highlighted PRs

* [PR #8652](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8652) :: chore(*): update lean to 3.32.1

  The community fork of Lean made two new
  [releases](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean/blob/master/doc/changes.md#3321c-12-august-2021)
  `3.32.0` and `3.32.1`.
  This is part of the preparations for porting mathlib to Lean 4.

* [PR #8281](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8281) :: feat(topology,geometry/manifold): continuous and smooth partition of unity

  See the [companion blogpost](continuous-partitions-of-unity/) for details.

* Radon-Nikodym and Lebesgue decomposition. The four PRs
  [PR #8645](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8645)
  [PR #8687](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8687)
  [PR #8763](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8763)
  [PR #8875](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8875)
  together contribute
  the Lebesgue decomposition for sigma-finite measures
  and the Radon-Nikodym theorem.

* [PR #7978](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/7978) :: feat(measure_theory/interval_integral): strong version of FTC-2

  This PR signals the start of a serious attack on Stokes' theorem,
  which will unlock a general approach to complex analysis.

* [PR #8692](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8692) :: feat(field_theory): finite fields exist

  Most of this PR had been lying around for ages,
  but it was finally put together in mathlib.
  It shows the existence and uniqueness of finite fields.

* Among several PRs from the Dedekind project, the two most noteworthy are
  - [PR #8530](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8530) :: feat(ring_theory): ideals in a Dedekind domain have unique factorization
  - [PR #8626](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8626) :: feat(ring_theory): define the ideal class group

* [PR #8377](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8377) :: feat(analysis/complex/upper_half_plane): new file

  This PR defines the complex upper half plane, together with the $\mathrm{SL}_2$-action.
  Upcoming PRs will characterize the fundamental domain of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-action.
